# Creating an NFT on Telos - Part 2

In Part 2 of the NFT course, we will learn to implement three more functions of our NFT contract that support the transfer and burning of NFTs.

## Overview

This part of the project will cover:
- Implementing the transfer function to allow users to transfer their NFTs to others.
- Adding the burn function to enable users to destroy their NFTs.

By the end of this part, you will have a fully functional NFT contract with advanced capabilities.
