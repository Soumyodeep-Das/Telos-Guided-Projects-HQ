# Creating an NFT on Telos

## What is an NFT?

NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) are unique digital assets stored on the blockchain, representing ownership of distinct items such as art, music, or collectibles. Unlike cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, which are fungible and can be exchanged on a one-to-one basis, NFTs are one-of-a-kind and cannot be exchanged on a like-for-like basis.
